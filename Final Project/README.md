# Change Log
- Iteration1 (iter1)
  
Built a basic game engine with an import random range. As well as a live/attempts system. One problem with this is that the lives and game engine are intergrated as one.

- Iteration2 (iter2)

I changed somethings from iteration1. I turned the random.randint range into a variable. attempts also got chenged into a variable. I made game engine/attempts into a function. 

- Iteration3 (iter3)

I added a replay loop that partially works. The quit faction of it works, but replay replays the wrong stuff. changed a bit of it and now it broken very broken.

- Iteration4 (iter4)

Compleated the replay loop so that it works
