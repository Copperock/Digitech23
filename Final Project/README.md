# Read me for final project
This is the read me for my final project in Digitech1a. 
 It will contain things I need to add over iterations with start and finsh dates. As well as a change me log which will hopefully line up with what I have said the change is in github. With a more detailed list of what it is that I have done in the change.

It will contain
- Things I need to add over iterations.
- A change me log with a bit more detail then what github will get.

# Change Log
- Iteration1 (iter1)
  
Built a basic game engine with an import random range. As well as a live/attempts system. One problem with this is that the lives and game engine are intergrated as one.

- Iteration2 (iter2)

I changed somethings from iteration1. I turned the random.randint range into a variable. attempts also got chenged into a variable. I made game engine/attempts into a function. 

- Iteration3 (iter3)

Added a replay loop that fully works. Also started testing my code with an excel sheet. Checked the pep8 compliance.

- Iteration4 (iter4)
