This is code for my 2023 Sem A lvl1 class.

To run code from repl you will need to input to the shell "python3 (folderName)/(codeName.codeType)" 
delete the brackets and the words inside and replace with what you desire to input to the shell.
Note: This code was written in [replit](https://replit.com/) so I don't know how well this would run in a different ide.
