# 1.6.1

This code is for week 1.6.1.

---
"AreWeThereYet.py" is the program I created for a task "make a while loop"

---
"ifelse.py" is the program that I made to output spefic line of code, the input for that is diffucult to guess. I would suggest you just look through the code to get one of the many inputs. Of which will then output the wanted line of code.
